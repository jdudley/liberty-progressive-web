# Liberty Progressive Framework

A political philosophy grounded in freedom, fallibilism, and decentralized problem-solving.

## What is Liberty Progressivism?

Liberty Progressivism descends from the Enlightenment tradition and critical rationalism. It holds that **the means of progress are more fundamental than any particular progressive outcome**. If we protect the mechanisms of error correction—free speech, distributed power, decentralized experimentation—good outcomes can emerge from the iterative process of learning.

## The Two Principal Axes

Modern progressivism can be mapped along two key dimensions:

### Liberty ↔ Statist
Where do you locate problem-solving capacity?
- **Liberty**: Contestable, plural, exit-based systems
- **Statist**: Centralized coordination with uniform standards and expert control

### Reformer ↔ Revolutionary
How should change occur?
- **Reformer**: Iterative error correction with reversibility and dissent tolerance
- **Revolutionary**: Urgent transformation with moral certainty

## The Four Quadrants

| | Reformer | Revolutionary |
|---|---|---|
| **Liberty** | Epistemic Reformers | Open System Radicals |
| **Statist** | Technocratic Pragmatists | Moral Centralizers |

## Working with Claude Code

This project includes a `CLAUDE.md` file and `context/` folder specifically designed to help Claude Code understand the project when making edits. The context includes:

- Framework summary and intellectual foundations
- Quiz design principles and scoring logic
- Style guidelines and common tasks

When using Claude Code, it will automatically read `CLAUDE.md` to understand the project context.
