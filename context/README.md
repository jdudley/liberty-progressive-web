## Usage with Claude Code

When working on this project with Claude Code, these documents provide the necessary context for:

1. Understanding the philosophical foundations
2. Making edits that are consistent with the framework
3. Adding new content or questions
4. Debugging scoring logic

The main `CLAUDE.md` file in the project root provides a quick-start guide for common tasks.

## Adding the PDF

To complete this context folder, add your framework PDF:

```
context/
├── README.md (this file)
├── framework-summary.md
├── quiz-rubric.md
└── Liberty_Progressive_Framework_V_0_2.pdf  ← Add this
```

Note: Claude Code can read PDFs, so including the original document ensures full context is available.
